  "content": "## Vectors and Direction ##\r\n\r\nA variety of quantities that we may study in the physical world include distance, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, force, mass, momentum, energy, work, power, etc. All these quantities can be divided into two categories - vectors and scalars. A vector quantity is a quantity that is fully described by both magnitude and direction. On the other hand, a scalar quantity is a quantity that is fully described by its magnitude. The emphasis of this unit is to understand some fundamentals about vectors and understand some situations in which they may be applied.\r\n\r\n![There is a bag of gold 20m away?
