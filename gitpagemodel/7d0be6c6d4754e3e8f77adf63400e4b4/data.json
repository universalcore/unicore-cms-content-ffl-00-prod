To protect food from germs:\n\n  * keep food preparation surfaces clean\n  * keep knives, cooking utensils, pots and plates clean and covered\n  * wash cloths used to clean dishes or pans thoroughly every day and dry them in the sun. Wash plates, utensils and pans immediately after eating and put them on a rack to dry\n  * keep food in clean, covered containers to protect it from insects and animals\n  * do not use feeding bottles or teats, because they may contain germs that cause diarrhoea. Breastfeed, or feed children from a clean, open cup. If bottles/teats are used, clean them after each use with boiling water.\n\n",
